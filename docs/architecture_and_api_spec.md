## **1. Executive Summary**
This document establishes the architecture and API contract for the Identity and Access Management (IAM) module of the **Access to Credit (A2C)** service component. In alignment with our Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) security mandates, the platform operates a **purely decoupled, API-first (headless)** architecture. 

It provides secure, stateless **JWT-based authentication** for ReactJS and Flutter frontends, while fully reusing **Frappe's native database layer, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and transactional password reset protocols**. This approach maximizes security, future-proofs the system for enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO), and completely avoids reinventing native framework security wheels.

---

## **2. System Architecture & Topology**

The Access to Credit platform operates a stateless security layer. The external ReactJS and Flutter applications never hold permanent session state. Instead, they authenticate to receive a short-lived cryptographically signed token (JWT) which they pass on all subsequent API requests.

## **3. Roles & RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

We explicitly avoid custom role management. We map incoming JWT sessions to Frappe's native `Has Role` schema.

### **3.1 Custom Roles Defined**
We will configure two new primary roles in the system using standard Frappe permissions:

1.  **`Bank Agent`**:
    *   **Scope:** Employee of a participating commercial bank (e.g., Coop Bank).
    *   **Desk Access:** Disabled (`desk_access = 0`). Only allowed to interact with the system via standard external API contracts.
    *   **Permissions:** Can `Read` leads assigned to their bank; can `Create`, `Read`, and `Submit` `A2C Loan Application` records.
2.  **`Development Agent` (DA)**:
    *   **Scope:** Field officers under the Ministry of Agriculture/ATI assisting rural farmers.
    *   **Desk Access:** Disabled (`desk_access = 0`).
    *   **Permissions:** Can `Create` and `Read` `A2C Lead` entries; can view status of applications they initiated, but cannot edit or view bank-specific risk parameters.

### **3.2 Multi-Tenant Data Isolation (User Permissions)**
To prevent horizontal privilege escalation (e.g., Bank Agent A seeing Bank Agent B's applications):
*   We use Frappe's native **User Permissions**.
*   Users with the `Bank Agent` role are linked to a specific `Participating Bank` document.
*   The Frappe ORM automatically injects database filters during queries so that endpoints like `get_leads` only return records matched to their linked bank.

---

### **3.3 Lead Management Database Schema (A2C Lead)**
The `A2C Lead` DocType acts as the absolute top of the funnel. It is designed to be extremely lightweight, capturing the initial point of contact (usually an automated missed call log) before any heavy agricultural or identity profiling begins.

#### **Lead Metadata**
| Field ID | Label | Field Type | Parameters / Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `phone_number` | Phone Number | Data (Phone) | Mandatory, Unique (active leads) | The primary identifier captured from the missed call or IVR system. |
| `external_id` | External Reference ID | Data | Optional, Indexed, Programmatically Unique | The correlation ID supplied by the external telco/IVR system. Used for O(1) deduplication. |
| `first_name` | First Name | Data | Optional | The farmer's first name. |
| `last_name` | Last Name | Data | Optional | The farmer's last name. |
| `email` | Email | Data | Optional, Email format | The farmer's email address. |
| `lead_source` | Source | Select | `Missed Call`, `IVR`, `SMS`, `Agent Entry` | Origin of the lead (defaults to Missed Call). |
| `status` | Lead Status | Select | `Active`, `Verified`, `Processed`, `Granted`, `Rejected`, `Dormant` | Workflow state of the initial discovery call. |
| `assigned_to` | Assigned Agent | Link | `User` (DocType) | The call center agent or DA tasked with calling the farmer back. |
| `call_notes` | Initial Call Notes | Text | Multiline | Brief summary of the initial discovery call. |
| `linked_credit_case`| Converted Credit Case | Link | `A2C Credit Case` (DocType) | Read-only reference populated automatically when the lead expresses interest. |

**Lead Lifecycle Constraint:** Once the `status` reaches **`Processed`** and the `A2C Credit Case` is initialized, this Lead document becomes immutable (locked). All subsequent heavy data gathering (names, addresses, farm details) happens entirely inside the `A2C Credit Case`.

**Conditional Uniqueness Policy:** Internal agents can create manual leads directly via the Desk without an `external_id`. To allow this while preventing duplicate external ingestions, the system enforces database-level indexing for $O(1)$ lookup speeds but handles the unique constraint programmatically in the controller (`before_save`).

---

### **3.4 Credit Information Schema (A2C Credit Information)**
This schema captures requested loan profiles associated with a discovery lead before initiating a formal underwriting case.

| Field ID | Label | Field Type | Parameters / Options | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `lead` | Lead | Link | Options: `A2C Lead` (Mandatory) | The associated lead. |
| `loan_type` | Loan Type | Select | Lookup options (Mandatory) | The category of credit requested by the lead. |
| `loan_amount` | Loan Amount | Currency | Numeric (Mandatory) | The amount requested in ETB. |
| `purpose_message` | Purpose Message | Small Text | Mandatory | Detailed text/notes explaining the requirement. |
| `created_by` | Created By | Link | Options: `User` (Read Only) | The agent who recorded the request. |

**Permissions Policy:**
*   **`Development Agent` (DA):** Can Create and Read records.
*   **`Bank Agent`:** Read-only access.
*   **`System Manager`:** Full permissions.

## **4. Core API Specifications**

All endpoints are built using `@frappe.whitelist()` and are versioned under the `oan_a2c.api.auth` namespace.

### **4.1 User Login (JWT Generation)**
Authenticates email and password, returning a stateless JWT and user profile metadata.

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/method/oan_a2c.api.auth.login`
*   **Authentication Required:** No (Guest Access Allowed)
*   **Request Headers:**
    *   `Content-Type: application/json`
*   **Request Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "usr": "agent.ethiopia@coopbank.com",
      "pwd": "SuperSecurePassword123!"
    }
    ```
*   **Success Response (HTTP 200):**
    ```json
    {
      "message": {
        "status": "success",
        "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiYWdlbnQuZXRoaW9waWFAY29vcGJhbmsuY29tIiwicm9sZXMiOlsiQmFuayBBZ2VudCJdLCJleHAiOjE3Nzk4NjU2MDB9...",
        "user": {
          "email": "agent.ethiopia@coopbank.com",
          "full_name": "Abebe Bikila",
          "roles": ["Bank Agent"],
          "bank": "Cooperative Bank of Oromia"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Error Response (HTTP 401 Unauthorized):**
    ```json
    {
      "exception": "frappe.exceptions.AuthenticationError",
      "message": "Incorrect email or password."
    }
    ```

---

### **4.2 Forgot Password Request**
Triggers Frappe's native secure password recovery flow. The backend generates a temporary cryptographically secure token, writes it to the database, and sends an automated reset email containing a link to the user.

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/method/oan_a2c.api.auth.forgot_password`
*   **Authentication Required:** No
*   **Request Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "email": "agent.ethiopia@coopbank.com"
    }
    ```
*   **Success Response (HTTP 200):**
    ```json
    {
      "message": {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Password reset instructions have been sent to your registered email."
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Architectural Rationale:** We use Frappe's native `frappe.core.doctype.user.user.reset_password(email)` internally. This ensures we inherit all of Frappe's default system protections:
    1.  Validating if the user account is active and not locked.
    2.  Automatic email formatting using the site's standardized system notification templates.
    3.  Enforcing temporary link expiry (standard link lifespan is 24 hours).
    4.  Avoiding storing password reset tokens in plain text in transit.

---

### **4.3 Password Reset Link Handling (Decoupled Bridge)**
When the agent clicks the link in their email:
1.  They are directed to a clean frontend landing page (ReactJS/Flutter).
2.  The URL contains parameters: `?key=<secure_key>&email=<email>`.
3.  The frontend displays a "New Password" form, capturing the input and posting it back to the backend.

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/method/oan_a2c.api.auth.reset_password`
*   **Authentication Required:** No (Key-authenticated)
*   **Request Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "email": "agent.ethiopia@coopbank.com",
      "key": "a8f3b23c91e1d0f8...",
      "new_password": "NewSuperSecurePassword987!"
    }
    ```
*   **Success Response (HTTP 200):**
    ```json
    {
      "message": {
        "status": "success",
        "message": "Your password has been successfully updated. You may now login."
      }
    }
    ```

---

### **4.4 External Lead Ingestion Webhook**
To support automated intake from external telecommunication systems (e.g., IVR or Missed Call gateways), this dedicated webhook acts as the automated funnel entry.

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/method/oan_a2c.api.v1.webhooks.lead_inbound`
*   **Authentication Required:** Yes (System API Key & API Secret via standard Frappe `Authorization: token <key>:<secret>` header).
*   **Request Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "phone_number": "+251911000000",
      "lead_source": "Missed Call",
      "external_ref_id": "TELCO-778899",
      "timestamp": "2026-05-19T10:00:00Z"
    }
    ```
*   **Success Response (HTTP 200):**
    ```json
    {
      "message": {
        "status": "success",
        "lead_id": "LEAD-2026-00001",
        "message": "Lead captured successfully."
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Idempotency & Dual-ID Deduplication Logic:** 
    1. **Primary Check (External Reference):** If `external_ref_id` is supplied, the webhook queries the indexed `external_id` field. If a match is found (even if closed or processed), it is updated idempotently rather than duplicated.
    2. **Secondary Check (Active Funnel):** If no `external_ref_id` matches but an active lead (status `Active` or `Verified`) already exists for the supplied `phone_number`, the system updates the existing lead's `call_notes` with the new event data.
    3. **Ingest & Creation:** If both checks fail, a new `A2C Lead` is created with the `external_id` set to `external_ref_id` to preserve lineage.

---

### **4.5 Paginated Lead Search & Filtering API**
Exposes a secure, JWT-authenticated endpoint to query and retrieve leads with multi-faceted filtering, elastic offset pagination, and bounded limits to prevent memory-exhaustion attacks.

*   **Endpoint:** `GET /api/method/oan_a2c.api.v1.leads.get_leads`
*   **Authentication Required:** Yes (JWT Bearer Token inside standard `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header).

    *   `start` *(Optional Int)*: Offset index to begin slice retrieval (defaults to `0`).
    *   `page_length` *(Optional Int)*: Max slice count to return (defaults to `20`, hard-capped at `100`).
    *   `search_query` *(Optional String)*: Fuzzy match substring querying across `name` (Lead ID), `phone_number`, and `external_id`.
    *   `status` *(Optional String)*: Filter matching strict schema values (`Active`, `Verified`, `Processed`, `Granted`, `Rejected`, `Dormant`).
    *   `lead_source` *(Optional String)*: Filter matching source (`Missed Call`, `IVR`, `SMS`, `Agent Entry`).
    *   `start_date` / `end_date` *(Optional String, YYYY-MM-DD)*: Boundary range matching Lead creation dates.
*   **Success Response (HTTP 200):**
    ```json
    {
      "message": {
        "status": "success",
        "start": 0,
        "page_length": 2,
        "total_count": 142,
        "results": [
          {
            "name": "LEAD-2026-00001",
            "phone_number": "+251911000001",
            "external_id": "TELCO-778899",
            "lead_source": "Missed Call",
            "status": "Verified",
            "assigned_to": "agent.ethiopia@coopbank.com",
            "creation": "2026-05-26 12:00:00"
          },
          {
            "name": "LEAD-2026-00002",
            "phone_number": "+251911000002",
            "external_id": null,
            "lead_source": "Agent Entry",
            "status": "Active",
            "assigned_to": null,
            "creation": "2026-05-26 12:05:00"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

---

### **4.6 Native Lead Creation API**
Exposes a secure, JWT-authenticated endpoint to create a new `A2C Lead` natively from the A2C field agent interface.

*   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/method/oan_a2c.api.v1.leads.create_lead`
*   **Authentication Required:** Yes (JWT Bearer Token inside standard `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header).

      "phone_number": "+251911000003",
      "first_name": "Abebe",
      "last_name": "Bikila",
      "email": "abebe.bikila@coopbank.com",
      "lead_source": "Agent Entry",
      "external_id": "PARTNER-990011"
    }
    ```
*   **Success Response (HTTP 200):**
    ```json
    {
      "message": {
        "status": "success",
        "lead_id": "LEAD-2026-00003",
        "message": "Lead created successfully."
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Validation Rules:**
    1. **Role Permissions:** Authenticated user must have create permission on `A2C Lead`.
    2. **Phone & External ID Duplication:** Conditional uniqueness rules on active phone numbers and external IDs are evaluated natively by the controller.
    3. **Email Formatting:** Enforces strict regex validation on the email address.

---

### **4.7 Get Lead Summary (Metrics Dashboard)**

## **5. Security, Cryptography, & Middleware**

To protect sensitive agricultural and credit data under Ethiopia’s regional data protection frameworks:

### **5.1 JWT Design Specs**
*   **Signing Algorithm:** HMAC SHA-256 (`HS256`).
*   **Signature Key:** Derived directly from the local site's private salt (`encryption_key` inside `site_config.json`). This ensures that even if the source code is compromised, tokens cannot be forged without access to the host's runtime environment.
*   **Token Expiration:** Short-lived access tokens (standard expiry is 1 hour).
*   **Token Payload:**
    ```json
    {
      "sub": "agent.ethiopia@coopbank.com",
      "iss": "oan_a2c_identity_gateway",
      "iat": 1779862000,
      "exp": 1779865600,
      "roles": ["Bank Agent"]
    }
    ```

### **5.2 Authentication Middleware Hook**
We implement our JWT validation at the entry boundary. In `hooks.py`, we bind a function to the standard Rest API entry points:

```python
# Pseudo-implementation within oan_a2c/hooks.py
auth_hooks = [
    "oan_a2c.api.auth.middleware.validate_jwt_request"
]
```

#### **How the `validate_jwt_request` hook executes:**
1.  Intercepts all requests under `/api/method/oan_a2c.*`.
2.  Looks for the `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header.
3.  Decodes the JWT using the private site key.
4.  If the signature is intact and the timestamp `exp` is in the future:
    *   Calls `frappe.set_user(jwt_payload['sub'])` to securely log the user context into the Python thread memory.
5.  If validation fails (expired or tampered signature), returns an HTTP 401 response and blocks execution before any business controllers are hit.
